# When-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Meet-Graph-Neural-Networks-A-Case-Study-for-Glaucoma-Detection
This is my Guided Research Project done at German Research Center for AI
# Description:
This code provides a python- PyTorch, PyTorch-Geometric implemetation of a research project which uses power of two networks Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Glaucoma detection in images provided within the scope of ORIGA-650 dataset. 

# Libraries Used:
Pytorch Geometric library: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and image processing libraries.

# Usage:
1) python adding_conv_layers_in_r18.py
